# chanz-it-vue-assignment
A Vue Assignment using Vue 3 + Materialize CSS

## Requirements
- Should be able to create a list of colleagues by name and age.
- Should be able to add name and age to a **second list** that is empty when the application is launched.
- When colleagues appear in this second list, we no longer want to see the entries in the original list, however, they remain distinct that they came from the original list.
- If you have time left, we would also like to see something with Vue Transitions within the application

Not part of the requirements, but these are bonus added features:
- Adding a colleague in the new list that came from the original should also take it's original age.
- Name capitalization handling
